# Base

The `base/` folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the project. In there, you might find some typographic rules, and probably a stylesheet (that I’m used to calling `_base.scss`), defining some standard styles for commonly used HTML elements.

E.g. Home to:
- Reset/normalize
- Universal site typography
